A Technical Blueprint for Developing a Catan-Inspired Multiplayer Web ApplicationPart I: Foundational Analysis: Deconstructing the Game and its Digital CounterpartThis initial analysis establishes the foundational requirements for the project. It begins by addressing the critical legal considerations inherent in cloning a commercial product, then codifies the game's rules into a set of technical specifications, and finally deconstructs the target application, colonist.io, to understand its specific implementation choices and user experience.Section 1.1: Pro-Bono Counsel: Navigating Intellectual PropertyThe stated goal to "copy the user interface and functionality as much as possible" of colonist.io necessitates a preliminary legal and ethical review. Colonist.io is a commercial entity with a professional team (1), and the Catan brand itself is a valuable and legally protected intellectual property. A direct clone would likely constitute infringement, leading to potential legal challenges.A more prudent and creatively fulfilling strategy is to develop a "spiritual successor" or a functionally similar homage. This approach focuses on replicating the core gameplay experience—the primary motivation for this project—while creating a unique visual identity. This path mitigates legal risk and provides greater creative freedom.The following analysis delineates the boundaries of what can and cannot be replicated:Game Mechanics and Rules: The fundamental rules of a game are considered ideas or processes and are generally not protected by copyright law. Therefore, implementing the mechanics of Catan, such as resource collection, trading, and building, is permissible (2).Visuals, UI, and Artwork: The specific visual expression of colonist.io—including its icons, card designs, board art, and user interface layout—is protected by copyright and potentially trade dress. Direct copying of these assets constitutes infringement. This project must source or create original assets.Source Code and Name: The underlying code of colonist.io is proprietary and cannot be copied. Similarly, the name "Catan" is a registered trademark and should not be used in the project's title or branding to avoid confusion or infringement.By reframing the project as a custom implementation inspired by Catan and colonist.io, the development process becomes an exercise in engineering a familiar game system rather than simple plagiarism. This report will guide the construction of the game's functionality while leveraging open-source and freely available assets to ensure a distinct and legally sound final product.Section 1.2: Codifying Catan: Core Game Mechanics as System RequirementsTo build a faithful implementation, the official rules of the Catan base game must be translated into a precise set of system requirements. These rules, derived from official sources (2), will form the backbone of the server-side game logic.Game SetupThe game begins with a setup phase where the environment and players are initialized.Player Initialization: Each of the 3-4 players selects a color and receives their starting game pieces: 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads. They also receive a Building Costs card for reference (2).Board Initialization: The game board is assembled from hexagonal terrain tiles. Special "Longest Road" and "Largest Army" cards are placed alongside the board, along with two six-sided dice (2).Initial Placement: The game proceeds with an initial placement phase. In turn order, each player places one settlement on a hex corner (intersection) and one adjacent road along a hex edge. After all players have placed their first settlement and road, the turn order reverses, and each player places a second settlement and a second road. Players collect one resource card for each terrain hex adjacent to their second placed settlement (3).The Distance Rule: A fundamental constraint in placement is the Distance Rule, which states that a new settlement must be at least two intersections away from any existing settlement, regardless of ownership (3). This ensures settlements are spaced out across the board.Turn StructureA player's turn is composed of a strict sequence of three phases (2):Resource Production: The player must roll the two dice. The sum of the dice determines which terrain hexes produce resources for that turn.Trade: The player may trade resources with other players (domestic trade) or with the bank (maritime trade).Build: The player may spend their resource cards to build roads, settlements, or cities, and/or to buy Development Cards.A player may play one Development Card at any point during their turn (before, after, or in between other actions), with a key exception: a Development Card cannot be played on the same turn it was purchased (4). The only exception to this is playing a Victory Point card to win the game on that turn.Resource Production and ManagementProduction Roll: When a number is rolled, any hex with a matching number token produces its corresponding resource. Every player with a settlement on an intersection bordering that hex receives one resource card of that type. A city on a bordering intersection yields two resource cards (2).Resource Scarcity: A critical rule often overlooked is how to handle resource shortages in the bank. If there are not enough resource cards in the supply to give all players the full amount they are due, then no player receives any of that resource during that turn (2). This rule is strictly enforced by colonist.io and must be implemented.The Robber and Rolling a '7': If a player rolls a '7', a special sequence occurs (2):No resources are produced.Every player holding more than seven resource cards must discard half of their hand (rounded down) to the bank.The player who rolled the '7' must move the robber from its current location to any other resource-producing hex (not the desert). This hex is now blocked and will not produce resources as long as the robber is on it.The player then steals one random resource card from one opponent who has a settlement or city adjacent to the robber's new location.Building and DevelopmentPlayers use resources to expand their presence on the board. All building costs and components must be tracked accurately.Roads: Require 1 Brick and 1 Lumber. A new road must be connected to one of the player's existing roads, settlements, or cities. Only one road can be built on any given path (3).Settlements: Require 1 Brick, 1 Lumber, 1 Wool, and 1 Grain. A new settlement must be connected to one of the player's roads and must adhere to the Distance Rule. Each settlement is worth 1 victory point (2).Cities: Require 2 Grain and 3 Ore. A city is an upgrade to an existing settlement. The settlement piece is returned to the player's supply and replaced by a city piece. Cities produce double the resources and are worth 2 victory points (2).Development Cards: Require 1 Ore, 1 Grain, and 1 Wool. When purchased, the player draws the top card from the shuffled Development Card deck. These cards are kept hidden until played (2).Victory ConditionsThe game ends when a player reaches a total of 10 or more victory points on their turn. Victory points are acquired from the following sources (4):Settlements: 1 VP each.Cities: 2 VP each.Longest Road: 2 VP for the player with the longest continuous road of at least 5 segments. This card can change hands if another player builds an even longer road (3).Largest Army: 2 VP for the player who has played the most Knight cards (a minimum of 3). This card can also change hands if another player plays more Knights (3).Victory Point Cards: Certain Development Cards provide 1 VP when revealed (3).ItemCostVictory PointsMax QuantityNotesRoad1 Lumber, 1 Brick015Must connect to existing pieces.Settlement1 Lumber, 1 Brick, 1 Grain, 1 Wool15Must obey Distance Rule.City2 Grain, 3 Ore24Upgrades an existing settlement.Development Card1 Grain, 1 Wool, 1 OreVariesN/ACannot be played on the turn it is purchased.Section 1.3: Expansion Logic: The 5-6 Player VariantThe core motivation for this project is to enable games with more than four players. This requires a detailed understanding of the Catan 5-6 Player Expansion, which modifies several base game rules to accommodate the increased player count and larger board (6).Components and Board SetupThe expansion adds new components to the base game, including two new sets of player pieces (typically brown and green), additional terrain hexes, resource cards, development cards, and frame pieces to create a larger island (7). The setup process involves using all hexes from both the base game and the expansion, but only the number tokens provided with the expansion, which are lettered for a specific spiral placement pattern (6).The Evolution of the Turn StructureA critical aspect of the 5-6 player expansion is how it manages game flow to prevent excessive downtime between a player's turns. Research reveals that the rules for this have evolved over time, presenting a key architectural decision.The Special Building Phase (Legacy Rule): Older versions of the expansion introduced a "Special Building Phase" (SBP) that occurs after the active player's turn concludes (7). During the SBP, every other player, proceeding in clockwise order, may build items or buy development cards using the resources currently in their hand. No trading (with players or the bank) or playing of development cards is permitted during this phase (8). While this keeps players engaged, it can significantly lengthen the time between turns, as up to five players may take actions.The Paired Player Turn (Modern Rule): More recent revisions of the 5-6 player rules, as well as digital implementations like Catan Universe, have replaced the SBP with a "Paired Player" system (5). This system is designed to be faster and more streamlined.Pairing: The active player is designated "Player 1." The player three positions to their left is designated "Player 2" (6).Player 1's Turn: Player 1 takes a complete, normal turn: they roll, trade with any player or the bank, build, and can play a development card.Player 2's Turn: After Player 1 has completely finished their actions, Player 2 may take a limited turn. They can build anything they can afford and play one development card. Crucially, they may only trade with the supply (maritime trade), not with other players (6).Progression: After Player 2 finishes, the dice and the "Player 1" marker pass to the player on the original Player 1's left, and a new pair is formed for the next turn.The shift from the SBP to the Paired Player rule reflects a design choice by the game's creators to improve the pacing and balance of larger games. The SBP can lead to long periods of inaction for the current player and can give an informational advantage to those who build later in the phase. The Paired Player system is more focused, involving only one additional player in a limited capacity, which keeps the game moving more briskly. For a modern and authentic implementation that mirrors the current official ruleset, the Paired Player system is the recommended approach and will be the basis for the logic designed in this blueprint.Section 1.4: Case Study: The colonist.io ImplementationTo create a successful homage, it is essential to analyze the user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and specific rule interpretations of the target application, colonist.io. This platform has evolved over years, incorporating user feedback and developing features that enhance the core Catan experience (10).UI and UX FlowThe user journey on colonist.io is streamlined for quick access to games.Lobby and Game Creation: The main landing page presents clear options to join different game modes (e.g., 1v1, 4 Player, Cities & Knights) or to view available game rooms (13). Creating a custom game opens a lobby with a detailed settings panel. This panel allows the host to configure Victory Points to Win, Card Discard Limit, and the maximum number of players (up to 8) (13). The design of this lobby has been subject to user feedback, particularly regarding the need to scroll for settings, suggesting that a more compact layout would be an improvement (14).In-Game Interface: The central focus of the screen is the game board. Player information—including their name, victory points, resource card count, and development card count—is typically arranged around the board's periphery. A dedicated area for game logs and player chat is a key feature, facilitating the negotiation and social interaction that is central to Catan (15). Actions are performed through a clear build menu, which allows players to select which item they wish to construct.The Trading Interface: Trading is one of the most complex interactions in Catan, and colonist.io has dedicated significant design effort to its trading UI (17). A successful clone must replicate this functionality. Key features include:Intuitive Layout: A three-section vertical layout clearly separates the proposing player, the resources being offered ("give"), and the resources being requested ("receive").Bank Trading: A distinct "Bank" tab simplifies maritime trades, making it clear to the user that they are not trading with another player.Contextual Ratios: Player-specific trade ratios (e.g., from a 3:1 harbor or a 2:1 wool port) are displayed directly on their resource cards, providing constant visual reminders of their trading power.Trade Feedback: When a trade is proposed, icons appear next to each opponent's name indicating their response (e.g., accepted, rejected, or pending), mimicking the social feedback of a physical game.Flexible Offers: The system allows players to propose counteroffers even if they don't currently possess the requested resources. It also supports "wildcard" or open-ended trades, such as offering one resource for "any" other resource, which speeds up negotiation.Gameplay Nuances and "House Rules"colonist.io implements several specific interpretations of the rules that must be included for an authentic experience.Strict Bank Limits: The platform correctly enforces the resource scarcity rule. If the bank cannot pay out a resource to all entitled players, none receive it (5). The resource counts are finite: 19 of each for a 3-4 player game, and 24 for a 5-6 player game (5).Forced Bank Trades: A notable "house rule" is the restriction on player-to-player trades that mimic bank rates. A player cannot offer, for example, four sheep for one brick to another player; the UI forces this type of trade to be conducted with the bank (5). This prevents players from colluding to circumvent poor port access.Meta-Game Features: While out of scope for an initial build, colonist.io's success is partly due to its meta-game systems like Karma, ranked leaderboards, a friends system, and game replays (10). The architecture of the clone should be designed with robust user and game data models to accommodate such features in the future.Part II: Architectural Foundations for a Real-Time Strategy GameThis section translates the functional requirements and analysis from Part I into a concrete technical architecture. The decisions outlined here will form the structural blueprint for the application, defining its technology stack, data flow, and scalability.Section 2.1: Technology Stack SelectionA modern, robust technology stack is required to handle the demands of a real-time, interactive multiplayer game. As the user-provided template was inaccessible (18), this plan defines a suitable stack from the ground up, focusing on technologies well-suited for this application domain. The recommended stack is MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) supplemented with Socket.IO for real-time communication.Node.js (Backend Runtime): Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that excels at building scalable network applications. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model is highly efficient for handling numerous concurrent connections with low overhead, which is essential for a multiplayer game server (19).Express.js (Backend Framework): Running on Node.js, Express is a minimal and flexible web application framework. It will be used to create the RESTful API for handling user authentication (registration, login) and serving the initial client application.React (Frontend Library): React is a declarative, component-based library for building user interfaces. Its component model is ideal for creating a complex and dynamic game UI. Individual elements like the hexagonal tiles, player HUDs, and the build menu can be encapsulated as reusable components, each managing its own state. This simplifies development and maintenance (20).MongoDB (Database): MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database. Its flexible, JSON-like document structure is a natural fit for storing complex and nested game state objects. User profiles, game configurations, and game history can be stored efficiently without the rigid schema constraints of a relational database (21).Socket.IO (Real-Time Communication): Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication. It abstracts the complexities of WebSockets, providing a simple API for emitting and listening to events. It also includes helpful features like automatic reconnection and fallbacks for older browsers, making it a robust choice for the game's real-time layer (19).ComponentTechnologyJustificationFrontendReactComponent-based architecture simplifies building a complex, interactive UI. Strong ecosystem for state management (e.g., Redux, Zustand).BackendNode.js & Express.jsEvent-driven, non-blocking I/O is highly performant for real-time applications with many concurrent users. JavaScript ecosystem allows for code sharing.DatabaseMongoDBFlexible document model is ideal for storing nested and evolving game state objects and user data. Scales well horizontally.Real-Time LayerSocket.IOProvides a reliable, event-based abstraction over WebSockets, simplifying real-time client-server communication and handling connection management.Section 2.2: The Server-Authoritative Model: The Single Source of TruthTo ensure a fair and cheat-proof gaming experience, the application must be built on a server-authoritative architecture (23). In this model, the server is the sole arbiter of truth for all game-related data and logic.Master Game State: The complete and accurate state of every ongoing game—including the board layout, number tokens, player hand contents, piece locations, and turn order—resides exclusively on the server.Client as a "Dumb" Terminal: The client-side application (the user's browser) does not contain any game logic. Its primary responsibilities are:Rendering the game state as provided by the server.Capturing user input (e.g., a click to build a road).Transmitting user actions as "intents" to the server.Server-Side Validation: When the server receives an intent from a client (e.g., client:build_road with specific coordinates), it validates this action against the master game state and the codified game rules. For a road, it would check: Is it this player's turn? Do they have 1 brick and 1 lumber? Is the proposed location valid and connected to their other pieces?State Broadcast: If the action is valid, the server updates the master game state. It then broadcasts the entire updated game state (or a relevant diff) to all clients in the game room. The clients receive this new state and simply re-render their UIs to reflect the change.This architecture centralizes all rule enforcement on the server, making it impossible for a malicious client to perform invalid actions, such as giving themselves extra resources or building without paying. It also simplifies client-side development, as the client does not need to know the game's rules, only how to display its state.Section 2.3: Real-Time Communication Protocol with WebSocketsThe communication between the client and server will be managed through a well-defined protocol of Socket.IO events. This protocol acts as the API for the real-time layer of the application.Event NameEmitterPayloadDescriptionconnectionSystemsocketA new client has connected to the server.disconnectSystemreasonA client has disconnected.client:create_roomClient{ gameSettings }Request to create a new game room with specified settings.client:join_roomClient{ roomCode }Request to join an existing game room.server:room_updateServer{ players, gameSettings }Broadcasts updated lobby information to all clients in a room.client:start_gameClient{}Request from the host to start the game.server:game_startedServer{ gameState }Broadcasts the initial game state to all players.client:roll_diceClient{}The current player requests to roll the dice.server:dice_rolledServer{ player, diceResult }Broadcasts the result of the dice roll to all players.client:build_itemClient{ item, location }Request to build an item (e.g., 'road', 'settlement') at a location.client:propose_tradeClient{ offer, request }Propose a trade to other players.server:trade_proposedServer{ fromPlayer, offer, request }Broadcasts a trade offer to all other players.client:respond_to_tradeClient{ toPlayer, response }A player responds ('accept'/'reject') to a trade offer.client:end_turnClient{}The current player ends their turn.server:game_state_updateServer{ gameState }The primary broadcast event. Sent after any valid action that changes the game state.server:errorServer{ message }Sent to a specific client when they attempt an invalid action.server:game_overServer{ winner, finalState }Broadcasts that the game has ended and declares the winner.Section 2.4: Data Modeling and PersistenceThe application's data will be stored in MongoDB using a structure designed for both user management and game persistence. The use of Mongoose, a Node.js object data modeling (ODM) library, will help enforce structure on the data.Table 4: Core MongoDB SchemasUsers CollectionThis collection stores information about each registered user.FieldData TypeDescription_idObjectIdUnique identifier for the user document.usernameStringThe user's public display name.

A naive approach of asking the agent to "build the game" will fail. Instead, a structured workflow of providing well-scoped tasks, rich context, and continuous oversight is required for success.Section 3.1: Mastering Copilot Agent Mode: Best PracticesThe successful use of Copilot Agent Mode hinges on treating it not as a magic black box, but as a junior developer that requires clear direction and supervision. The following best practices are synthesized from official documentation and expert usage patterns (25).Use the Right Tool for the Job: Copilot is a suite of tools. Agent mode is powerful but not always the most efficient choice.Agent Mode (/@agent): Reserve for complex, multi-step, multi-file tasks like "Implement the user registration feature, including the API endpoint, database model, and frontend form" (28).Edit Mode (/edit): Use for targeted changes within a specific context, such as "Refactor this function to be asynchronous" or "Add error handling to this block of code" (28).Fix Command (/fix): Use for debugging. When an error occurs, highlight the problematic code and use /fix to get suggestions (28).Decompose Complex Problems: The most critical practice is to break down the large goal ("build a Catan clone") into smaller, logically-contained tasks. The implementation roadmap in Part IV is explicitly designed around this principle. Each PR represents a single, well-scoped task that the agent can reasonably accomplish (26).Provide Rich and Relevant Context: The quality of the agent's output is directly proportional to the quality of the context provided.Open Files: Before invoking the agent, have the relevant files open in the editor (e.g., the model, the service, and the controller file for a new feature) (26).Use Context Markers: Explicitly reference key files, functions, or variables in the prompt using the #file or #selection syntax to focus the agent's attention (26).Act as the Senior Developer: The developer is the pilot, and the agent is the copilot.Review Everything: Meticulously review every line of code the agent suggests. Check for logic errors, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to project style.Approve Commands: The agent may suggest running terminal commands (e.g., npm install). Always review and approve these commands before execution (28).Iterate and Correct: If the agent's output is incorrect or incomplete, provide corrective feedback. Rephrase the prompt, point out the error, and ask for a revision. The agent can learn from test failures and linting errors, so running tests after its changes is a powerful feedback loop (26).Section 3.2: Structuring Agent Prompts for This ProjectApplying the best practices, here are templates for prompts that should be used throughout this project's development.Initial Project Scaffolding:/@agent Initialize a new MERN stack project. Create a root directory with two subdirectories: serverandclient. In server, initialize a Node.js project and install express, mongoose, socket.io, cors, dotenv, and bcryptjs. In client, initialize a new React project using Vite and TypeScript, and install socket.io-client. Create a basic Express server in server/index.jsthat serves a "Hello World" message and a basic React component inclient/src/App.tsx that displays a "Hello World" message.Backend Feature Implementation:/@agent Implement the server-side logic for building a settlement. In the file server/src/services/gameService.ts, create a function named buildSettlement(gameId, userId, position). This function must validate the action against the game state stored in MongoDB, referencing the schema in server/src/models/Game.ts(#file:server/src/models/Game.ts). The validation rules are: 1. The player must have 1 Brick, 1 Lumber, 1 Grain, and 1 Wool. 2. The intersection atpositionmust be unoccupied. 3. The placement must adhere to the Distance Rule (no other settlement or city within 2 intersections). 4. The player must have one of their own roads connected to theposition. If all checks pass, debit the resources from the player, update the game state with the new settlement, increment the player's victory points, and save the updated game document. Return the updated game state. Create a corresponding controller and route in Express to handle this action.Frontend Component Creation:/@agent Create a React component named TradeModal.tsx. This component should replicate the trading UI from colonist.io. It needs state to manage the resources being offered and requested. It should display the player's own cards and their available trade ratios (from props). It must have a "Bank" tab and a "Player" tab. When a trade is proposed, it should emit a client:propose_trade socket event with the trade details.Test Generation:/@agent Using Jest, write unit tests for the buildSettlementfunction ingameService.ts. Create a new file server/src/services/gameService.test.ts. Mock the Game.findById function to provide various game state scenarios. Write test cases that cover: a successful build, attempting to build with insufficient resources, attempting to build on an occupied spot, and attempting to build in violation of the Distance Rule. (32)Section 3.3: Asset Acquisition and IntegrationTo create a visually distinct product and avoid copyright infringement, the project will use freely available or open-source assets. A structured approach to acquiring and organizing these assets is necessary.Asset Sourcing Strategy:Hexagonal Tiles: The backend logic will be managed by a library like honeycomb (33). For the frontend visuals, tile sets can be found on sites like OpenGameArt (34), itch.io (35), or Kenney (36). These sites offer various styles (pixel art, cartoon, etc.) under permissive licenses.Resource & Development Cards: UI kits specifically for card games are available and can be adapted (37). Generic card templates can be found on open-source repositories and then customized with resource icons.Resource Icons (Wood, Brick, etc.): Game-icons.net (39) provides a massive, searchable library of SVG icons perfect for this purpose. Flaticon (40) and CraftPix (41) are also excellent sources.UI Elements (Buttons, Panels, Menus): Kenney's UI packs are a go-to resource, providing a complete and stylistically consistent set of buttons, sliders, and panels that are ideal for a board game interface (36).Asset Integration Plan:Create a dedicated directory in the client application: /client/src/assets.Within this directory, create subdirectories for icons, tiles, cards, and ui.As assets are downloaded from the sources above, they will be placed in the appropriate subdirectory.All React components that render these assets will import them directly from this organized structure. This keeps all visual assets in a single, manageable location.Part IV: The Implementation Roadmap: A Phased, PR-Style To-Do ListThis section provides a granular, step-by-step implementation plan. Each item is framed as a Pull Request (PR) with a title and a detailed description that can be used as a prompt for GitHub Copilot Agent Mode. This phased approach builds the application from the ground up, ensuring a solid foundation before adding complexity.Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Backend FoundationThis phase establishes the project structure, user authentication, and the basic real-time lobby system.PR #1: feat(project): Initialize MERN stack with TypeScript and Socket.IO/@agent Create a monorepo structure with serverandclientdirectories. Initialize theserverwith Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. Install dependencies:express, mongoose, socket.io, cors, dotenv, bcryptjs. Configure a basic Express server that listens on a port defined in a.env file. Initialize the clientwith React, Vite, and TypeScript. Installsocket.io-client. Establish a basic Socket.IO connection between the client and server, logging a "user connected" message on the server when the React app loads.PR #2: feat(auth): Implement User Model, Registration, and Login/@agent Create a MongoDB User schema in server/src/models/User.tswith fields forusername, email, and passwordHashas defined in the data model (Part 2.4). Create Express API routes for/api/users/registerand/api/users/login. The registration route should hash the password using bcrypt before saving the new user. The login route should compare the provided password with the stored hash and, if successful, issue a JSON Web Token (JWT).PR #3: feat(lobby): Implement Game Room and Lobby Logic/@agent Create a MongoDB Game schema in server/src/models/Game.tsas defined in the data model (Part 2.4), focusing onroomCode, host, players, and status. Implement Socket.IO event handlers on the server for client:create_roomandclient:join_room. create_roomshould generate a unique 4-letterroomCode, create a new Game document, and place the creator in the lobby. join_roomshould validate theroomCode, add the player to the Game document, and have both sockets join a Socket.IO room. Broadcast a server:room_update event with the current player list to all clients in the room whenever a player joins.Phase 2: Core Game Logic Implementation (Server-Side)This is the most complex phase, where the entire rule set of Catan is implemented on the server.PR #4: feat(game-state): Implement Game State Machine & Turn Management/@agent In a new file server/src/game/gameState.ts, create a class or factory function to manage the game state. Implement logic to handle the initial setup phase (placing two settlements and roads per player). Implement turn progression, cycling through players in order. The state machine should track the current player and the current turn phase ('setup', 'roll', 'trade_build', 'game_over').PR #5: feat(board): Implement Hexagonal Board Generation/@agent In a new file server/src/game/boardGenerator.ts, create a function that generates a valid Catan board configuration for a 3-4 player game. It should create the correct number of each terrain type (Forest, Hills, etc.) and randomly distribute them in the standard hexagonal shape. It must then assign the number tokens (2-12, excluding 7) to the terrain hexes, ensuring that red numbers (6 and 8) are not adjacent to each other.PR #6: feat(rules): Implement Dice Rolling and Resource Production/@agent Implement the logic for client:roll_dice. The server should generate two random numbers from 1-6. On a non-7 roll, identify the hexes that match the total. Iterate through all players and check if they have settlements or cities adjacent to the producing hexes. Calculate the total resources owed for each type. Before distributing, check the bank's supply. If the bank has enough, debit the bank and credit the players. If not, no player receives that resource, per the scarcity rule. Broadcast the dice roll result and the updated game state.PR #7: feat(rules): Implement Robber Logic/@agent Enhance the dice roll logic. If the roll is a 7, trigger the robber sequence. First, identify all players with more than 7 resource cards and notify them they must discard. Await their discard actions. Once all required players have discarded, notify the current player to move the robber. Validate their chosen hex. Update the robber's position in the game state. Identify valid opponents to steal from and allow the player to choose one. Randomly select one card from the victim's hand and transfer it. Broadcast the updated game state.PR #8: feat(rules): Implement Building Logic and Validation/@agent Create server-side validation functions for buildRoad, buildSettlement, and buildCity. Each function must rigorously check resource costs against the player's hand, piece limits against the player's supply, and placement rules against the current board state (connectivity for roads, Distance Rule for settlements). If valid, update the game state by debiting resources, placing the piece, and updating VPs. Broadcast the server:game_state_update event.PR #9: feat(rules): Implement Development Card Logic/@agent Implement the logic for buying and playing development cards. Create a function to generate the initial shuffled deck. When a player buys a card, debit their resources and assign them the top card. Implement the effects for playing each card type: Knight (move robber, increment army count), Monopoly (steal all of one resource from all players), Year of Plenty (take 2 resources from the bank), Road Building (place 2 roads for free), and Victory Point (increment VP). Enforce the rule that a card cannot be played on the turn it was bought.PR #10: feat(rules): Implement Trading Logic/@agent Implement server-side logic for all forms of trade. For maritime trade, validate the player has the resources and the correct port access. For domestic trade, handle the client:propose_tradeevent by broadcasting the offer to other players. Handleclient:respond_to_tradeevents. If a trade is accepted, perform the resource swap between the two players in the game state and notify all players that the trade was completed. Enforce thecolonist.io house rule that prevents players from making 4:1 offers to each other.PR #11: feat(rules): Implement Victory Conditions/@agent After every action that could change a player's victory point total (building a settlement/city, playing a VP card, taking Longest Road/Largest Army), run a check. This check should calculate the current VPs for the active player. If the total is 10 or more, change the game status to 'finished', and broadcast a server:game_over event containing the winner's ID and the final game state.Phase 3: Frontend Development & UI ImplementationThis phase focuses on building the client-side React application to visualize the game and interact with the server.PR #12: feat(ui): Set Up React Frontend with State Management/@agent In the clientdirectory, set up a global state management solution (e.g., Zustand or Redux Toolkit). Create a central store for thegameState. Create a socketService.tsfile to manage the Socket.IO connection. This service should listen forserver:game_state_update events and update the global store accordingly. React components will then subscribe to this store.PR #13: feat(ui): Create Game Board Component/@agent Create a Board.tsxcomponent. This component will receive theboardobject from the global state. Using SVG or CSS, render the hexagonal grid based on the hex data. Render the terrain tiles using the assets from/client/src/assets/tiles. Display the number tokens and ports. Place the robber piece on the correct hex.PR #14: feat(ui): Create Player HUD Components/@agent Create a PlayerHUD.tsxcomponent to display the current player's information: their resource cards (with counts), their hidden development cards, and their available pieces. Create anOpponentHUD.tsx component that displays the public information for other players: name, VP, resource card count, dev card count, and largest army/longest road status.PR #15: feat(ui): Implement Interactive Build Menu/@agent Create a BuildMenu.tsxcomponent. It should display buttons for Road, Settlement, City, and Development Card. The buttons should be disabled if the player cannot afford the item, based on thegameStatefrom the store. When a player clicks a build button (e.g., "Build Road"), the application should enter a "placement mode," highlighting valid placement locations on the board. Clicking a valid location should emit aclient:build_item event to the server.PR #16: feat(ui): Implement Trading Modal/@agent Create a TradeModal.tsxcomponent. This modal should allow the active player to construct a trade offer by selecting resources to give and receive. It should have a tab for trading with the bank (maritime trade) and a tab for trading with players. When an offer is submitted, it should emit aclient:propose_trade event. The component should also be able to display incoming trade offers from other players, with buttons to accept or reject.PR #17: feat(ui): Implement Game Chat and Event Log/@agent Create a Log.tsx component with two tabs: Chat and Game Log. The Game Log tab should display a history of key events (dice rolls, builds, trades) received from the server. The Chat tab should allow players to send and receive messages, managed through Socket.IO events.Phase 4: Expansion and RefinementThis final phase implements the core 5-6 player feature and adds essential testing and a basic AI for playability.PR #18: feat(expansion): Adapt Game Logic and UI for 5-6 Players/@agent Modify the boardGenerator.ts to create the larger 5-6 player board layout. Update the server-side turn management logic to implement the **Paired Player** rule as defined in Part 1.3. On the frontend, adjust the UI layout to gracefully accommodate up to 6 player HUDs around the board.PR #19: test(core): Implement Unit Tests for Game Logic/@agent Using Jest, create a suite of unit tests for the core game logic services. Focus on the validation functions in gameService.ts. Write comprehensive tests for all building rules, trading logic, and resource production calculations to ensure they are bug-free and adhere to the Catan rules.PR #20: feat(ai): Implement Basic Bot AI/@agent Create a botPlayer.ts service on the server. When it is a bot's turn, this service will analyze the game state and make a decision. The initial AI should be simple and rule-based: 1. If it can build a settlement to get a new resource number, do it. 2. Else, if it can build a city on a high-producing spot, do it. 3. Else, if it can build a road, do it. 4. Else, if it can afford a development card, buy one. 5. If it has a Knight card and the robber is on its hex, play the Knight. The bot will not trade initially.Part V: Conclusion and Next StepsThis report has provided a comprehensive technical blueprint for developing a web-based, multiplayer game inspired by Catan and colonist.io. By adhering to the legal guidance, codifying the game rules into precise requirements, and adopting a modern, server-authoritative architecture, the project is positioned for success. The detailed, phased implementation roadmap, designed specifically for use with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, breaks down a complex undertaking into a series of manageable, well-scoped tasks.Following this plan will result in a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that captures the essence of Catan, including the crucial 5-6 player experience, while maintaining a unique visual identity to avoid intellectual property conflicts.Future EnhancementsOnce the MVP is complete and stable, the robust foundation laid by this architecture will allow for numerous future enhancements, including:Advanced AI: Improving the bot AI to include trading behavior, strategic placement, and more sophisticated decision-making.Expanded Game Modes: Implementing official Catan expansions like Cities & Knights (9) or Seafarers, which would require significant additions to the game state model and rule logic.User Profile and Meta-Game: Building out the user profile to include detailed statistics, achievements, and a Karma or reputation system similar to colonist.io's (11).Social Features: Implementing a friends list, private messaging, and game invitations.Game Replays: Storing a log of all game state changes to allow players to watch and analyze completed games, a feature highly requested by competitive communities (10).The successful execution of this project will not only fulfill the initial goal of creating a free-to-play Catan-like experience but will also serve as a significant and educational software engineering endeavor.
